# AI_USAGE.md

## What AI generated
- The overall project scaffold including directories, filenames and file structures.
- Boilerplate code for loading the dataset, building TF‑IDF pipelines with Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, training, evaluation and CLI prediction.
- Initial documentation templates for the README, project plan, design notes, implementation guide, testing plan, learning log, data card and model card.

## What I edited
- Updated the dataset references to focus on the Enron email spam corpus rather than SMS data.
- Adjusted the documentation to explain the email domain and added clarifications on assumptions and limitations.
- Added a small sample CSV and updated code to handle email text.

## Prompts (summary)
- “Build a week‑sized spam classifier with Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression using the Enron email dataset, TF‑IDF features, evaluation metrics and a CLI.”
